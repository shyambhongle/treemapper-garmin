//! Everything that talks to the TreeMapper phone app.
//!
//! The model is a mailbox, not a socket: parcels are posted in both
//! directions and an event fires on arrival. There is no session, no
//! handshake at the transport level, and no delivery guarantee, so this class
//! adds the three things the field needs:
//!
//!   1. One transmit in flight at a time. The BLE link returns BLE_QUEUE_FULL
//!      if you push several at once, and a dropped point is lost work.
//!   2. An explicit acknowledgement, so the watch only lets go of a fix once
//!      the phone actually has it.
//!   3. A view of whether anyone is listening, which is not the same thing as
//!      whether a phone is paired.
//!
//! PROTOCOL VERSION 1. Keep this in step with the phone app.
//!
//! Phone to watch
//!   {"c":"hello"}            identify, ask for current state
//!   {"c":"fix", "r":<n>}     send one point now, tagged with request id n
//!   {"c":"ping"}             keepalive, answered with a state message
//!
//! Watch to phone
//!   {"t":"ready", "v":1, "q":<0-4>, "gps":<0|1>, "buf":0, "mb":<0|1>}
//!   {"t":"pt",    "r":<n or null>, "n":<seq>, "src":"phone"|"watch",
//!                 "lat":<Double>, "lon":<Double>, "alt":<Float or null>,
//!                 "q":<0-4>, "ts":<epoch s>, "spd":<Float or null>}
//!   {"t":"err",   "r":<n or null>, "code":"no_position"}
//!
//! Every point carries `q`, the raw Position.Quality value, and nothing is
//! filtered on the watch. The phone decides what is good enough.
//! Protocol version. Module scope, not a class constant: Monkey C does not
//! expose a class const as ClassName.CONST without an instance.
